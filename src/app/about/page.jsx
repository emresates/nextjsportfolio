            My proficiency lies in creating interactive and visually appealing
            web applications using cutting-edge technologies such as React,
            Next.js and JavaScript. Throughout my previous projects, I have
            embraced various CSS preprocessors including Sass, Bootstrap,
            Tailwind, Material UI, and Styled Components, which enabled me to
            craft intuitive and user-centric interfaces.
            <br />
            <br />
            What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to excellence and the
            desire to expand my skillset beyond frontend development. I am keen
            on exploring new horizons in the realm of full-stack development,
            empowering me to tackle diverse projects with technical prowess.
            <br />
            <br />I have effectively communicated with our team to understand
            and address customer needs. Furthermore, through effective time
            management and prioritization skills, I can plan efficiently to
            complete projects within deadlines. I am proficient in both English
            and Turkish languages, allowing me to communicate seamlessly with
            clients, team members, and project stakeholders.
